# TikTok-Shares-Botter
Adds TikTok Shares for you.

## Information
This tool was developed to demonstrate how simple it is to abuse a service like TikTok. Using this tool will definitely cause the video to be on the TikTok "For You" page — increases chances of becoming TikTok famous. Please refrain from using this TikTok Shares Botter as it was once again only developed for educational purposes. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk.

## Legal Notice
This is illegal if you use this without the consent of the owners — in this case, the TikTok team. I am not accountable for anything you get into; this was merely a speedrun to demonstrate how botters work. This is 100% educational, please do not misuse this tool.
